# Dancing-Robot
_A HoloLens application allowing collaborative viewing and manipulation of the 3D model of an ABB welding robot._

## Origins
There were two main drivers for this project: to understand the capabilities of the Windows Holographic platform, and to create a fun robot-oriented model to be shown at the first Autodesk Switzerland Design Night in October 2016 in Neuchatel.
The project is called "Dancing Robot" as the goal was to have the HoloLens model react in some way to music being played at the Design Night. This was ultimately achieved by having a Processing project - which was running on a separate system - send messages to the HoloLens for each beat of the music. More information is provided below.

The 3D asset for this model was generously provided by Tom Erikkson.
